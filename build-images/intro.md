This scenario is meant as a hands-on exercise for the module *Building Container Images*.
It assumes that you have watched the lectures provided within the module.

In this exercise, you will:

 - Write your first Dockerfile using the `RUN` and `CMD` instructions
 - Build an image from the Dockerfile
 - See how layer caching reduces the build time.
